example API call for Siemens to use:
   http://analyti.cz/bess_availability -d JSONPACKET

the json packet would look something like this:
   {"BESS_ID":"XYZ123",    
    "TimeFrom": <unix timestamp>
    "TimeTo": <unix timestamp>
    "Unit": "kW"  // alternatively kWh
 }
if the packet missed any of the data, we would use defaults of 'now to now+24hrs' and kWh
obviously there's just one battery, but we can have "batteryID" field just to point out scalability...

the response would be a packet that looks like this:
 {"BESS_ID": "XYZ123",
   "Availability": [ 
          { "TimeFrom": <timestamp>, "TimeTo": <timestamp>, "kW": 5.5},
          { "TimeFrom": <timestamp>, "TimeTo": <timestamp>, "kW": 5.1},
          ...
          { "TimeFrom": <timestamp>, "TimeTo": <timestamp>, "kW": 2.2}
     ]
}


possible  API for Nairn to use, to tell us about all the battery actions as and when they get planned.

  
   http://analyti.cz/bess_action -d JSONPACKET

the json packet would look something like this:

   {"BESS_ID":"XYZ123",    
     "Actions": [
        {"TimeFrom: <timestamp>, "TimeTo": <timestamp>, "Action": "Charge", "kW": 2.5},
        {"TimeFrom: <timestamp>, "TimeTo": <timestamp>, "Action": "Discharge", "kW": 1.5},
        ]
  } 

Alternatively, Nairn might prefer to provide an API or a DB access point whereby we can pick that up regularly.
